==================

An api system to make calls against to do bitcoin operations. 

This is a basic JSON api site that allows you to do operations on the bitcoin network without running a client. It is written in node.js and uses some of code from a developer of strongcoin transactional stuff.

This is totally a pet project that I am trying to give a little more attention to in my spare time, and it is admittedly a little messy. Feel free to check it out, run it yourself, and submit fixes or just add some organization to it.
